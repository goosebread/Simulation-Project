some code for this project for this class i'm in

we can make the cmake fancier if need be but we're probably fine just starting with vanilla cpp

for now, the .vscode folder will be included to facilitate the setting up of build environments if yall want to try running it

use ./build.sh to compile
use ./run.sh to run whatever's in main

use vscode's launch task to debug
